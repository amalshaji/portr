# Project rules and instructions

- Do not add unnecessary comments.
- The project uses go for the server and client and svelte for the UI.
- The admin server now resides in tunnel/internal/server/admin directory. The admin/ at the root is deprecated and will be removed in the v1 release.
- Use github.com/charmbracelet/log for structured logging.
- When making any changes, make sure to add/update tests for the same code.
