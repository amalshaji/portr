Along with email-password based login, you can also set up GitHub OAuth for authentication in the admin dashboard.

<Callout type="info">
  For this guide, we'll use `example.com` as your domain. Replace it with your actual domain.
</Callout>

## Setup Process

### Create a new OAuth App

Go to [https://github.com/settings/applications/new](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)

### Configure the application

Fill in the following details:

- **Application name**: Portr (or your preferred name)
- **Homepage URL**: `https://example.com`
- **Authorization callback URL**: `https://example.com/api/v1/auth/github/callback`

### Register the application

Click on **"Register application"** to create your OAuth app.

### Get your credentials

After creating the app, you'll see:
- **Client ID**: Copy this value
- **Client Secret**: Generate and copy this value

### Update your environment

Add the credentials to your `.env` file:

```bash
PORTR_ADMIN_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
PORTR_ADMIN_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

### Restart your services

Restart your Docker services to apply the changes:

```bash
docker compose restart
```

## Using GitHub OAuth

Once configured, users can log in to the admin dashboard using their GitHub accounts. The OAuth integration provides:

- **Simplified login**: Users don't need to create separate accounts
- **Enhanced security**: Leverages GitHub's authentication system
- **Team integration**: Easier to manage access for development teams

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure your callback URL exactly matches the one configured in your GitHub OAuth app. Any mismatch will cause authentication to fail.
</Callout>

## Testing the Integration

1. Navigate to your admin dashboard
2. Look for the "Sign in with GitHub" option
3. Click it to test the OAuth flow
4. You should be redirected to GitHub for authorization
5. After approval, you'll be redirected back to your admin dashboard
