The Cloudflare API token is required by Caddy for provisioning SSL certificates for wildcard subdomains.

## Setup Process

### Navigate to API tokens

Go to [https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)

### Create a new token

Click on **"Create Token"** to start the process.

### Configure permissions

Set the following permissions for your token:

```
Zone - DNS - Read
Zone - DNS - Edit
```

### Set zone resources

Configure the zone resources to include your specific domain:

```
Include - Specific zone - {your domain}
```

### Generate the token

Click **"Continue to summary"** and then **"Create Token"** to generate your API token.

### Save the token

Copy the generated token and add it to your `.env` file:

```bash
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

## Token Permissions Explained

The required permissions allow Caddy to:

- **DNS Read**: Verify existing DNS records
- **DNS Edit**: Create and modify DNS records for certificate validation
- **Zone-specific access**: Limit access to only your domain for security

## Security Best Practices

- **Limit scope**: Only grant access to the specific zone you need
- **Store securely**: Keep your API token in environment variables, never in code
- **Monitor usage**: Regularly check your Cloudflare dashboard for unusual activity
- **Rotate tokens**: Consider rotating your API tokens periodically

<Callout type="warning">
  Keep your API token secure and never commit it to version control. Anyone with this token can modify your DNS records.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate Issues

If you're experiencing SSL certificate problems:

1. Verify your API token has the correct permissions
2. Ensure your domain is properly configured in Cloudflare
3. Check that your DNS records are propagated
4. Review the Caddy logs for detailed error messages

### Testing Your Token

You can test your API token using the Cloudflare API:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
