import { Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

For quick setup, use the `docker-compose.yml` from the Portr repository:

[https://github.com/amalshaji/portr/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/amalshaji/portr/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml)

## Services Overview

The compose file includes 4 services:

- **caddy**: The reverse proxy for routing and SSL termination
- **admin**: The admin server for the web dashboard
- **tunnel**: The tunnel server for handling connections
- **postgres**: The PostgreSQL database

## Deployment Steps

### Download the compose file

Download the docker-compose.yaml file from the repository and place it in your server directory.

### Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the same directory with the following values:

```bash title=".env"
PORTR_ADMIN_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID= #optional
PORTR_ADMIN_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET= #optional

PORTR_DOMAIN=example.com
PORTR_DB_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/postgres

PORTR_SERVER_URL=example.com
PORTR_SSH_URL=example.com:2222

CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=

POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=postgres

PORTR_ADMIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=
```

### Generate encryption key

Generate an encryption key using the following command:

```shell
python -c "import base64, os; print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(os.urandom(32)).decode())"
```

Add this key to the `PORTR_ADMIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` variable in your `.env` file.

### Start the services

Run the following command to start all services:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

### Access the admin dashboard

Once the servers are running, navigate to your domain (e.g., `https://example.com`) and log in to the admin dashboard. The first login will be treated as a superuser account.

## Alternative Database Setup

<Callout type="info">
  If you want to run PostgreSQL separately and not as a Docker service, you can exclude the following environment variables from your `.env` file:
  - `POSTGRES_USER`
  - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` 
  - `POSTGRES_DB`
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Service Health Checks

Check if all services are running properly:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

### View Service Logs

Check logs for any specific service:

```bash
# View all logs
docker compose logs

# View logs for a specific service
docker compose logs admin
docker compose logs tunnel
docker compose logs caddy
```

### SSL Certificate Issues

If you're having SSL certificate issues, ensure:

1. Your DNS records are properly configured
2. Your Cloudflare API token has the correct permissions
3. Your domain is added to Cloudflare

### Port Accessibility

Verify that the required ports are accessible:

```bash
# Check if port 2222 is accessible
telnet your-domain.com 2222

# Check if HTTP/HTTPS ports are working
curl https://your-domain.com
```
