Portr is a self-hosted tunnel solution designed for teams. It lets you expose local HTTP, TCP, or WebSocket connections to the internet with a simple command-line interface.

You can use the client to quickly tunnel HTTP, TCP, or WebSocket connections:

```bash
portr http 9000
```

This command exposes your local HTTP server running at port `9000` on a public HTTPS URL.
