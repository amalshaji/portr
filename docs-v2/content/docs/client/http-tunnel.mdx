description: Learn how to start a http tunnel using portr
---

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

Use the following command to tunnel an HTTP connection.

```bash
portr http 9000
```

Or start it with a custom subdomain:

```bash
portr http 9000 --subdomain amal-test
```

<Callout type="info">
  This also starts the portr inspector on [http://localhost:7777](http://localhost:7777), where you can inspect and replay HTTP requests.
</Callout>

## How it works

When you run the HTTP tunnel command:

1. Portr connects to your configured server
2. Creates a secure tunnel from your local port to a public URL
3. Starts the request inspector interface locally
4. Routes all incoming requests through the tunnel to your local service

## Inspector Features

The Portr inspector provides powerful debugging capabilities:

- **Request inspection**: View all incoming HTTP requests in real-time
- **Request replay**: Replay any request with modifications
- **Headers analysis**: Examine request and response headers
- **Payload viewing**: Inspect request and response bodies

## Common Use Cases

- **Local web development**: Share your local development server with others
- **Webhook testing**: Receive webhooks from external services during development
- **API debugging**: Test API integrations with external services
- **Demo presentations**: Show your work to clients or team members
