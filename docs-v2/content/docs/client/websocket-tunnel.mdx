import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

WebSocket connections use the HTTP protocol for the initial handshake and then switch to use a TCP connection. Because of this, an HTTP tunnel will work perfectly for WebSocket connections.

```bash
portr http 9000
```

<Callout type="info">
  Use the HTTP tunnel command for WebSocket services. The initial HTTP handshake will be handled properly, and the connection will upgrade to WebSocket as expected.
</Callout>

## How WebSocket Tunneling Works

1. **Initial handshake**: The WebSocket connection starts with an HTTP request containing upgrade headers
2. **Protocol upgrade**: The server responds with a `101 Switching Protocols` status
3. **WebSocket connection**: The connection upgrades to WebSocket protocol over the existing TCP connection
4. **Bidirectional communication**: Full-duplex communication is established

## Testing WebSocket Connections

You can test your WebSocket tunnel using various tools:

### Browser Console
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://your-subdomain.your-domain.com');
ws.onopen = () => console.log('Connected');
ws.onmessage = (event) => console.log('Message:', event.data);
ws.send('Hello WebSocket!');
```

### Command Line Tools
```bash
# Using wscat (install with: npm install -g wscat)
wscat -c wss://your-subdomain.your-domain.com
```

## Common Use Cases

- **Real-time applications**: Chat applications, live updates, notifications
- **Live data feeds**: Stock prices, sensor data, live metrics
- **Collaborative tools**: Real-time document editing, shared whiteboards  
- **Gaming**: Multiplayer games, real-time game state synchronization
