import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

### Install the client

Using the install script:

```shell
curl -sSf https://install.portr.dev | sh
```

Or install the client using homebrew:

```shell
brew install amalshaji/taps/portr
```

You can also download the client binary from [github releases](https://github.com/amalshaji/portr/releases).

### Configure authentication

Once the download/install is complete, login to the portr admin dashboard and copy the setup command from the overview page. It'll look like this:

```bash
portr auth set --token {your_token} --remote {your_domain}
```

### Verify installation

For more details and to verify everything is working, run:

```bash
portr --help
```

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure you have access to a Portr server before setting up the client. If you need to set up your own server, check out the [server setup guide](/docs/server).
