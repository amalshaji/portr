import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

Use the following command to tunnel a TCP connection:

```bash
portr tcp 9000
```

<Callout type="info">
  TCP tunnels are useful for exposing services like databases, SSH servers, or any service that uses raw TCP connections.
</Callout>

## How it works

TCP tunnels work differently from HTTP tunnels:

1. Portr establishes a direct TCP connection between the remote client and your local service
2. No HTTP processing is involved - raw TCP data is forwarded
3. The connection is bidirectional and maintains the TCP session state

## Common Use Cases

- **Database access**: Connect to local databases from remote applications
- **SSH tunneling**: Access local SSH servers from remote locations  
- **Custom protocols**: Tunnel any service that uses TCP connections
- **Legacy applications**: Connect to services that don't use HTTP

## Port Requirements

<Callout type="warning">
  Your Portr server needs to have the port range `30001-40001` open to accept incoming TCP connections. Make sure your server administrator has configured these ports.
</Callout>

## Configuration

You can specify custom subdomains and ports just like with HTTP tunnels:

```bash
portr tcp 5432 --subdomain my-postgres
```
