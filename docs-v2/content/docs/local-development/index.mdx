This guide covers how to set up Portr for local development, whether you want to contribute to the project or modify it for your needs.

## Architecture Overview

Portr consists of several components:

- **Admin Server**: Go/Fiber backend with Svelte frontend (integrated with tunnel server)
- **Tunnel Server**: Go-based SSH and proxy server
- **Client**: Go-based CLI tool for creating tunnels

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Go 1.25+**
- **Node.js 20+**
- **pnpm 9.15.0+**
- **PostgreSQL 16+** or **SQLite 3.0+**

## Quick Start

<Callout type="info">
  The recommended development approach is to start all components in the
  following order: database → admin server → tunnel server → client.
</Callout>

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amalshaji/portr.git
cd portr
```

### 2. Set up the database

Start a PostgreSQL instance locally or use Docker:

```bash
docker run --name portr-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:16
```

### 3. Start development servers

Follow the individual setup guides for each component to get everything running locally.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how to get started:

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Create a feature branch** for your changes
3. **Set up the development environment** using the guides above
4. **Make your changes** and test them thoroughly
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your changes

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Start all required services locally
2. Make your changes to the relevant component
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Update documentation if needed

### Testing

Each component has its own test suite. Run tests before submitting changes:

```bash
# Go tests (from tunnel/ directory)
go test ./...

# Admin frontend tests (from tunnel/internal/server/admin/web/)
cd tunnel/internal/server/admin/web && pnpm test

# Format Go code
go fmt ./...

# Run Go linter
go vet ./...
```
