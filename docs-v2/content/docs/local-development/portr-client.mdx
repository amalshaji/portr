import { Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

The Portr client is built using Go for the CLI backend and includes a Svelte-based inspector for HTTP tunnels.

## Requirements

- **Go** (1.23+)
- **Node.js** (20+)
- **pnpm** (9.15.0+)
- **Running admin server** (for authentication)
- **Running tunnel server** (for tunnel connections)

## Frontend Setup (Inspector)

### Install frontend dependencies

```shell
make installclient
```

### Start the inspector development server

```shell
make runclient
```

This starts the Svelte-based inspector interface with hot reloading.

## CLI Setup

### Navigate to the tunnel directory

```shell
cd tunnel
```

### Build the CLI binary

```shell
make buildcli
```

This creates the `portr` binary in the current directory.

### Configure authentication

1. Start your admin server
2. Log in to the admin dashboard
3. Copy your secret key from the dashboard
4. Add it to `client.dev.yaml` configuration file

### Test the tunnel connection

Start a test tunnel:

```shell
./portr -c client.dev.yaml http 9999
```

## Development Workflow

### Client Architecture

The client consists of:

- **CLI interface**: Command-line tool for creating tunnels
- **Inspector frontend**: Svelte-based web interface for HTTP request inspection
- **Tunnel manager**: Handles SSH connections and port forwarding

### Available Commands

```bash
# Install inspector dependencies
make installclient

# Run inspector in development mode
make runclient

# Build the CLI binary
make buildcli

# Build inspector for production
make buildclient

# Run client tests
make test-cli

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

### Configuration Files

#### client.dev.yaml
Development configuration for the CLI:

```yaml
server_url: localhost:8001
ssh_url: localhost:2222
secret_key: your_secret_key_here
tunnels:
  - name: test
    subdomain: test
    port: 3000
```

#### Inspector Configuration
The inspector runs on `http://localhost:7777` by default and automatically connects to active HTTP tunnels.

## Testing Your Changes

### Unit Tests

Run the client test suite:

```bash
make test-cli
```

### Integration Testing

1. **Start all services**: admin → tunnel server → client
2. **Create a test service**: Run a simple HTTP server locally
3. **Create a tunnel**: Use your built client to tunnel the service
4. **Test connectivity**: Access the tunnel URL and verify it works
5. **Test inspector**: Check that HTTP requests appear in the inspector

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Start a simple HTTP server for testing
python -m http.server 8080

# In another terminal, create a tunnel
./portr -c client.dev.yaml http 8080

# Test the tunnel URL in your browser
```

## Inspector Development

The inspector is a Svelte application that provides:

- **Real-time request monitoring**: View HTTP requests as they happen
- **Request details**: Headers, body, timing information
- **Request replay**: Resend requests with modifications
- **WebSocket support**: Monitor WebSocket connections

### Inspector Structure

```

│   ├── routes/        # SvelteKit routes

```

<Callout type="info">
  The inspector automatically starts when you create an HTTP tunnel and is accessible at `http://localhost:7777`.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**Go build errors**: Ensure you're using Go 1.23+ and all dependencies are available.

**Frontend build errors**: Verify Node.js and pnpm versions, then try deleting `node_modules` and reinstalling.

### Runtime Issues

**Connection refused**: Make sure the tunnel server is running and accessible.

**Authentication failures**: Verify your secret key is correct and the admin server is running.

**Inspector not loading**: Check that port 7777 is available and the frontend build completed successfully.
