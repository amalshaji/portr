### Install the client

Install the client using homebrew:

```shell
brew tap amalshaji/taps
brew install portr
```

You can also download the client binary from [github releases](https://github.com/amalshaji/portr/releases).

Once the download/install is complete, login to the portr admin dashboard and copy the setup command from the overview page. It'll look like this.

```bash
portr auth set --token {your_token} --remote {your_domain}
```

<Aside type="tip">
  You can call `portr` directly if it's on $PATH, or installed via brew. The
  guide assumes you have the cli on the $PATH
</Aside>

### Start a http connection

```bash
portr http 9000
```

Or start it with a custom subdomain

```bash
portr http 9000 --subdomain amal-test
```

### Start a tcp connection

```bash
portr tcp 9000
```

### Defining tunnel services

If you use certain subdomains/port regularly, it is easier to create them as services and reuse using simple commands.
Open the portr client config file by running the following command

```bash
portr config edit
```

This should open a file with the following contents

```yml
server_url: example.com
ssh_url: example.com:2222
secret_key: { your-secret-key }
tunnels:
  - name: portr
    subdomain: portr
    port: 4321
```

You can create tunnel templates under the tunnels key to quickly start them.
For example, you can start the portr tunnel using `portr start portr`. You can also add a tcp connection by specifying the type of the connection.

```yml
tunnels:
  - name: portr
    subdomain: portr
    port: 4321
  - name: pg
    subdomain: portr
    port: 5432
    type: tcp
```

And start multiple services by using the command `portr start portr pg`.

For more details, run `portr --help`.
