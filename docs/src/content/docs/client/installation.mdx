import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

### Install the client

Install the client using homebrew:

```shell
brew install amalshaji/taps/portr
```

You can also download the client binary from [github releases](https://github.com/amalshaji/portr/releases).

Once the download/install is complete, login to the portr admin dashboard and copy the setup command from the overview page. It'll look like this.

```bash
portr auth set --token {your_token} --remote {your_domain}
```

For more details, run `portr --help`.
