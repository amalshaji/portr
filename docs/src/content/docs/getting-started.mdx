Portr is a self-hosted tunnel solution designed for teams. It lets you expose local http, tcp or websocket connections to the internet.

You can use the client to quickly tunnel http, tcp or websocket connections

```bash
portr http 9000
```

This command exposes your local http server running at port `9000` on a public https url.

Checkout how to quickly create a tunnel and inspect requests using portr inspector in the following video
